# Upskill Campus Python Internship

Welcome to the **Upskill Campus Python Internship** repository! This repository contains all the tasks and projects completed during my internship with Upskill Campus. The focus of this internship was to strengthen my Python programming skills and apply them to various real-world tasks and challenges.

## Project Overview

The Upskill Campus Python Internship provided me with the opportunity to work on a range of Python-based tasks. These include problem-solving, data manipulation, and the development of small applications. Through these tasks, I enhanced my coding abilities, learned best practices, and gained hands-on experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks**:
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - scikit-learn
- **Tools**:
  - Jupyter Notebook
  - Git

## Tasks and Projects

- **Task 1**: This script implements a URL shortener using the Cutt.ly API and Streamlit for the user interface. Here’s a quick breakdown of how it works:

### Key Features:
1. **Streamlit UI**: Users can input a full URL and a custom name for the shortened URL. The app uses two `text_input` fields for these.
2. **API Call**: When the user clicks the "Shorten Link" button, a request is made to the Cutt.ly API with the provided details.
3. **Response Handling**: The API response is parsed to check if the URL shortening was successful or if there were any errors (e.g., invalid URL, name already taken, etc.).
4. **Error Messages**: Proper error handling is implemented to show relevant messages based on the API's response.

### Potential Enhancements:
- **Security**: Hide or securely handle the API key in production. You can use environment variables or Streamlit secrets management to prevent exposure of the API key.
- **Styling**: Add more interactive or styled UI elements using Streamlit's advanced features, such as displaying the shortened link in a copyable format.

If you need further modifications or improvements, feel free to ask!

Each task contains detailed code, comments, and explanations of the steps involved in completing it.
